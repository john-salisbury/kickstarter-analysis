***

In this project, I clean and analyze data on over 250k Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns that took place in the United States between 2009-2018, **using logistic regression to identify factors that predict campaign success**.

In the [first notebook](https://john-salisbury.github.io/kickstarter-analysis) of this project, I explore, clean, and prepare the data for use in a logistic regression model. Then, in the [second notebook](https://john-salisbury.github.io/kickstarter-analysis) of this project, I run and interpret a logistic regression model, allowing me to determine if certain factors in our dataset can predict whether or not Kickstarter campaigns succeed.
